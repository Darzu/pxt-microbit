## Design and Make the Guitar body
* Search for [Guitar Silhouette](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=Guitar+Silhouettes) design ideas and customize
the shape of your guitar
* Trace the design on a flat piece of cardboard (40-80 cm is best)
   * *Tip:* avoid small details that are difficult to cut into cardboard
   * *Tip:* unfolding a box gives longer pieces of cardboard, and creases can be reinforced
* Strengthen the guitar and create unique styling using tape
* Finish design using markers, paint and other available materials (*calling all artist!*) 
* Strengthen the guitar next with an angled cardboard strip (*optional*)
