## Step 1: Design the body

* Search for [Guitar Silhouette](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=Guitar+Silhouettes) design ideas and customize
the shape of your guitar
* Trace the design on a flat piece of cardboard (40-80 cm is best)

![TRACING VIDEO]()

### ~hint

   * Avoid small details that are difficult to cut into cardboard
   * Unfolding a box gives longer pieces of cardboard, and creases can be reinforced

## Step 2: Cut out the body
